# Utopia Coder
Utopia Coder module defines the common features used between multiple code-generating Utopia applications, 
namely [Vault Coder](https://github.com/Mikkomario/Utopia-Coder/tree/master/Vault-Coder) and 
[Reach Coder](https://github.com/Mikkomario/Utopia-Coder/tree/master/Reach-Coder). 
See these modules for more details.

As this (generic Utopia Coder) library is mostly intended for internal use at the moment, 
we will not describe it here in detail.  
In case you're interested in developing your own code-generating application based on this module, please 
contact me and I will add further information.
